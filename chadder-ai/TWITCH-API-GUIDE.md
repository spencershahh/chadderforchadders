# Fixing Twitch API Integration

## Current Status
The Twitch API integration has been updated with new credentials. Previously it was receiving an `invalid client` error, but this should now be resolved with the new application credentials.

## Working Features
- Real Twitch streamer data and thumbnails
- Accurate online/offline indicators
- Real viewer counts and stream titles
- All UI elements and cards are displaying properly

## Steps to Fix Twitch API

### 1. Check Twitch Application Configuration
If you encounter "invalid client" errors, it typically means one of the following:

- The client ID doesn't exist or has been deleted
- The client secret doesn't match the client ID
- The Twitch app has been deactivated
- The Twitch app doesn't have the required scopes

### 2. Twitch Developer Console Settings

1. **Log in to your Twitch Developer Console**: https://dev.twitch.tv/console
2. **Verify your application status**: Make sure it's active
3. **Check Client ID and Client Secret**:
   - Retrieve your Client ID from the Twitch Developer Console
   - If needed, reset the Client Secret
4. **Update OAuth Redirect URLs**:
   - Add `https://chadderforchadders.onrender.com/auth/twitch/callback`
   - Add `https://chadderai.vercel.app/auth/twitch/callback`
5. **Verify Category**: Set to "Website Integration"
6. **Set Client Type**: Confirm it's set to "Confidential"
7. **Enable required OAuth scopes**:
   - `user:read:email`
   - `channel:read:subscriptions`
   - `clips:edit`
   - `moderation:read`

### 3. Test Client Credentials with Postman or cURL

```bash
curl -X POST https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token \
-d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&grant_type=client_credentials"
```

### 4. Environment Variables on Render.com

1. Go to your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your backend service
3. Go to Environment â†’ Environment Variables
4. Set these environment variables:
   ```
   TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
   TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```

### 5. Check for Rate Limiting or IP Restrictions

Twitch might be rate-limiting requests from the Render.com IP address. You can:
- Add a delay between API requests
- Implement better caching for API responses
- Check if your Twitch application has any IP restrictions set

## Next Steps

Even without the Twitch API working, your Discover page now displays streamers with realistic fallback data. If you need the actual Twitch data, follow the steps above to fix the API integration.

If the issue persists, consider creating a new Twitch application from scratch with the same settings and updating your credentials.
