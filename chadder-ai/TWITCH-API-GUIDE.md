# Fixing Twitch API Integration

## Current Status
The Twitch API integration is partially working. Our local testing confirms that the credentials are valid, but the Render.com deployment is receiving an `invalid client` error.

## Working Features
- Fallback streamer data with realistic profiles and thumbnails
- Online/offline indicators
- Random but consistent viewer counts and stream titles
- All UI elements and cards are displaying properly

## Twitch API Error Details
```
Response data: {"status":400,"message":"invalid client"}
```

## Steps to Fix Twitch API

### 1. Check Twitch Application Configuration
The "invalid client" error typically means one of the following:

- The client ID doesn't exist or has been deleted
- The client secret doesn't match the client ID
- The Twitch app has been deactivated
- The Twitch app doesn't have the required scopes

### 2. Update Twitch Developer Console Settings

1. **Log in to your Twitch Developer Console**: https://dev.twitch.tv/console
2. **Verify your application status**: Make sure it's active
3. **Check Client ID and Client Secret**:
   - Confirm Client ID: `wk5ebp17im6knf70jgs0oxiljihr3r`
   - Reset the Client Secret if necessary
4. **Update OAuth Redirect URLs**:
   - Add `https://chadderforchadders.onrender.com/auth/twitch/callback`
   - Add `https://chadderai.vercel.app/auth/twitch/callback`
5. **Verify Category**: Set to "Application Integration" or "Website Integration"
6. **Set Client Type**: Confirm it's set to "Confidential"
7. **Enable required OAuth scopes**:
   - `user:read:email`
   - `channel:read:subscriptions`
   - `clips:edit`
   - `moderation:read`

### 3. Test Client Credentials with Postman or cURL

```bash
curl -X POST https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token \
-d "client_id=wk5ebp17im6knf70jgs0oxiljihr3r&client_secret=dmlq88lzc5sp69j4une5wcqkx0o2el&grant_type=client_credentials"
```

### 4. Update Environment Variables on Render.com

1. Go to your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your backend service
3. Go to Environment â†’ Environment Variables
4. Verify these values are set exactly as below:
   ```
   TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=wk5ebp17im6knf70jgs0oxiljihr3r
   TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=dmlq88lzc5sp69j4une5wcqkx0o2el
   ```

### 5. Check for Rate Limiting or IP Restrictions

Twitch might be rate-limiting requests from the Render.com IP address. You can:
- Add a delay between API requests
- Implement better caching for API responses
- Check if your Twitch application has any IP restrictions set

## Next Steps

Even without the Twitch API working, your Discover page now displays streamers with realistic fallback data. If you need the actual Twitch data, follow the steps above to fix the API integration.

If the issue persists, consider creating a new Twitch application from scratch with the same settings and updating your credentials.
